# RequestForComments

By creating a Request for Comments (RFC) issue in this repository, you can make a make a proposal, collect feedback, build consensus, adopt a course of action, and track a decision’s implementation.

**RFCs are required when**
* Updating or Deprecating Interfaces, including changes to programming interfaces and removal of packages.
* TBD

**How to start a RFC**
* Create a [new RFC Issue](https://github.com/heather999/RequestForComments/issues) making sure to provide an adequate description of the situation and proposal as well as a "Planned End" date for comments.
* Please assign this issue to all potentially interested parties.  If unsure, please reach out to the your WG conveners and associated Coordinators.
* Once the issue is created, a notification will be posted to the #desc-rfc Slack channel
* All are welcome to comment through the indicated "Planned End" date.

**Escalation**
We should discuss what "body" would deal with approving escalated RFC.  Could be the WG convener & associated Coordinator

**Adoption**

Before an RFC may be adopted, one or more GitHub issues must be created to capture the work required to implement the RFC’s decision.

When
* the Planned End date has passed;
* the RFC is either labelled *proposed* (that is, it has not been escalated) or *approved* (it has been escalated and subsequently approved by some TBD decision making body);
* the assignee judges that positive consensus has been reached; and
* a set of triggered tickets have been defined

**Withdrawing an RFC**

If the RFC cannot be adopted (by consensus, decision of some TBD decision making body, or decision of the Assignee), then you can withdraw the RFC. Assign the *withdraw* label to the RFC issue.

**Implementing an RFC**

Once all the GitHub issues associated with an RFC have been closed, the RFC issue can be labelled as *implemented*.
