# DRAFT RequestForComments

## This is a demonstration only and not for actual use within DESC

Please feel free to open issues for Request For Comments. The individual submitting the request is not expected to take part in the  implementation of the idea presented.

By creating a Request for Comments (RFC) issue in this repository, you can make a proposal, collect feedback, build consensus, adopt a course of action, and track a decision’s implementation.


**How to start a RFC**
* Create a [new RFC Issue](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RequestForComments/issues) making sure to provide an adequate description of the situation and proposal.
* Once the issue is created, a notification will be posted to the #desc-rfc Slack channel
* All are welcome to comment.


**Adoption**

Before an RFC may be adopted, one or more GitHub issues should be created to capture the work required to implement the RFC’s decision.

* Label the RFC issue as *adopted* 
* Add the RFC issue to the [*Adopted* Project](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RequestForComments/projects/1)

**Withdrawing an RFC**

If the RFC cannot be adopted, then it can be withdrawn. Assign the *withdraw* label to the RFC issue.

**Implementing an RFC**

Create a [new Project in this repo](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/RequestForComments/projects) to help track any GitHub issues necessary for an RFCs implementation.

Once all the GitHub issues associated with an RFC have been closed, the RFC issue can be labelled as *implemented* and closed.
